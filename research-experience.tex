\section{Research Experience}
	\cventry{2010-present}
		{Computer Scientist}
		{\href{http://www.llnl.gov}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}{}{}
		{As team leader for the Performance Analysis and Visualization at Exascale project,
		 investigating use of topological data analysis techniques to correlate performance measurements with 
		 application model data.\newline
		 As part of the Exascale Computing Technologies (ExaCT) Strategic Initiative, researching scalable 
		 performance tools for machines with millions of cores.  Projects include Muster, a library for general
		 sampled cluster analysis on massively distributed data sets; Libra, a scalable load balance analysis tool,
		 and other HPC performance tool infrastructure projects.}
